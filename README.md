# Obstacle-Avoidance-Bot
Obstacle Avoidance Bot Simulator is a Python project where a virtual robot moves on a grid, avoiding obstacles using the A* pathfinding algorithm. Built with Pygame, it visually shows how the bot finds the shortest path from start to goal. A great way to learn basic robotics and smart navigation.
